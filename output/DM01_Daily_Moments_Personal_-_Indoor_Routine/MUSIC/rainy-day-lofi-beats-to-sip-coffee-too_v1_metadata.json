      "Warm lo-fi hip hop track",
      "60 seconds. Cozy indoor cafe atmosphere on a rainy day. Dusty upright piano with gentle Rhodes-like warmth",
      "saturated analog bass with soft tube distortion",
      "lazy swinging drum groove with crunchy bit-crushed texture and vinyl crackle layered throughout. Tempo around 85-95 BPM",
      "relaxed swing feel. Major key tonality",
      "comforting and inviting mood. Subtle background rain ambience optional. Smooth intro with piano and crackle",
      "drums enter around 8 seconds",
      "bass joins at 15 seconds. Maintain consistent warm energy throughout",
      "gentle fade at end. Think studying alone in a quiet corner booth",
      "steam rising from coffee",
      "windows fogged with rain."
